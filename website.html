        <p>
          Jack, a forgetful painter, once forgot his brushes for an important
          job. In a pinch, he used a broom to paint. Surprisingly, the painting
          turned out amazing, impressing his client.

        <h2>The Lazy Farmer</h2>
        <p>
          here was once a lazy farmer named Tom who always looked for shortcuts.
          One day, he decided to plant corn but didn’t want to put in the effort
          to water the seeds. Instead, he hoped for rain. Days passed, and the
          seeds didn’t sprout. Tom’s neighbor, a hardworking farmer, noticed
          this and asked, “Why aren’t you watering your crops?” Tom replied,
          “I’m waiting for the rain to do the work for me.” The neighbor laughed
          and said, “Tom, if you want a good harvest, you have to put in the
          effort. Rain or no rain, you need to water your crops.” Realizing his
          mistake, Tom started watering his seeds daily. Soon, his corn grew
          tall and healthy, and he had a bountiful harvest.

        <h2>The Procrastinating Student</h2>
        <h3 class="name-highlight">A Short Story</h3>
        <p>
          There was a student named Sam who always procrastinated. One day, he
          had a big exam but decided to watch TV instead of studying. The night
          before the exam, he realized he hadn’t studied at all. Panicking, Sam
          grabbed his books and started cramming. He stayed up all night, trying
          to learn everything in a few hours. The next day, he was exhausted but
          went to take the exam anyway. To his surprise, the questions were all
          about topics he had crammed the night before. Sam managed to pass the
          exam, but just barely. He realized that while he got lucky this time,
          he couldn’t rely on last-minute cramming for future success.

        <h2>The Forgetful Chef</h2>
        <h3 class="name-highlight">A Short Story</h3>
        <p>
          There was a chef named Lisa who was known for her delicious dishes but
          also for being very forgetful. One day, she was preparing a big meal
          for a famous food critic. In her rush, she accidentally used salt
          instead of sugar in her dessert recipe. When she realized her mistake,
          it was too late to start over. Thinking quickly, Lisa decided to turn
          her mistake into a new creation. She added some savory ingredients and
          turned the dessert into a unique sweet-and-salty treat. The food
          critic loved it and praised Lisa for her creativity and bold flavors.
          Her “mistake” became a hit, and she added it to her menu as a
          signature dish.
